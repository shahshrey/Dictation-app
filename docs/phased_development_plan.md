**Key Deliverables:**
- Performance optimization implementation
- Continuous dictation mode
- Language and punctuation support
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Advanced text processing features
- Performance monitoring tools

### Phase 5: Packaging and Distribution (13 days)
Phase 5 prepares the application for distribution to end users. This phase handles packaging, installer creation, auto-updates, documentation, and code signing to ensure a professional, reliable product.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Packaged application for macOS
- User-friendly installer with first-run experience
- Auto-update implementation
- Comprehensive documentation and help
- Code signed and notarized application
- Distribution strategy and release notes

## Development Approach

### Incremental Development
Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for testing and validation at each stage. This approach ensures that core functionality is solid before adding more complex features.

### Testing Strategy
- Unit testing for individual components
- Integration testing for component interactions
- End-to-end testing for complete workflows
- User acceptance testing for UI and UX

### Quality Assurance
- Code reviews for each major component
- Performance benchmarking
- Error handling validation
- Security assessment

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Python integration challenges | Early prototyping in Phase 1, comprehensive error handling |
| Performance issues with large models | Tiered model approach, performance optimization in Phase 4 |
| macOS permissions and security | Proper entitlements configuration, testing on multiple macOS versions |
| User experience complexity | Iterative UI design, user feedback incorporation |
| Dependency management | Explicit version pinning, comprehensive environment validation |

## Post-Development Activities

### Maintenance Plan
