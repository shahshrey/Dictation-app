# Project Requirement Document - Whisper Dictation App

## Introduction
The Whisper Dictation App is a lightweight, system-wide dictation tool that enables seamless voice-to-text transcription using local processing capabilities. This personal tool aims to provide a convenient way to dictate text into any text field across applications without relying on cloud services.

## Problem Statement
Traditional typing can be slow and inefficient for many users, especially when formulating complex thoughts or when multitasking. Existing dictation solutions often require internet connectivity, raise privacy concerns due to cloud processing, or lack system-wide integration capabilities.

## Solution
The Whisper Dictation App addresses these challenges by providing a locally-processed, system-wide dictation tool that can be activated with a simple keyboard shortcut. The app uses Python to run OpenAI's Whisper model locally, ensuring privacy and offline functionality while maintaining high transcription accuracy.

## Target Audience
The primary user is the developer (yourself), with potential for:
- Writers who prefer dictation over typing
- Professionals who frequently need to document thoughts quickly
- Users with accessibility needs who find dictation more convenient than typing

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Electron
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python
- **Speech Recognition**: Locally-hosted OpenAI Whisper model via Python
- **Dependencies**: FFmpeg, PyTorch
- **UI Design**: Minimalistic, material design principles
- **System Integration**: OS-level keyboard shortcut processing

## Core Features
1. **System-wide Dictation**: Ability to dictate text into any active text field across applications
2. **Keyboard Shortcut Activation**: Press and hold the home key to start dictation
3. **Visual Feedback**: Minimalist popup indicating active dictation status
4. **Local Processing**: Speech-to-text conversion processed entirely locally using Whisper
5. **Offline Functionality**: Works without internet connection
6. **Cursor-aware Text Insertion**: Automatically inserts transcribed text at the cursor position
7. **Real-time Transcription**: Provides real-time text output as speech is processed
8. **Model Selection**: Ability to choose different Whisper model sizes based on accuracy vs. speed requirements

## Scope of Work
### In Scope
- Electron application development
- Python integration for OpenAI Whisper model processing
- System-wide keyboard shortcut registration
- Popup UI for dictation status
- Text insertion at cursor position
- Multiple Whisper model size support (tiny, base, small, medium, large)
- GPU acceleration when available

### Out of Scope
- Cloud-based transcription options
- User accounts or multi-user support
- Saving or managing transcription history
- Advanced text editing features
- Cross-platform support (initial focus on macOS only)

## Success Criteria
- Successfully transcribes speech to text with reasonable accuracy
- Functions offline using local processing
- Integrates seamlessly with system-wide text fields
- Responds reliably to keyboard shortcut activation
- Maintains minimal resource usage when not actively transcribing
- Offers appropriate model size options for different hardware capabilities
