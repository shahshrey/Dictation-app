# Project Requirement Document - MacOS Dictation App

## Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for developing a macOS dictation application using Electron. The application aims to provide a seamless dictation experience with cloud-based speech-to-text processing via the Groq API.

## Problem Statement
Current dictation solutions on macOS have limitations in terms of customization, user experience, and integration with third-party AI services. Users need a lightweight, efficient dictation tool that can be triggered with a simple keyboard shortcut and provides high-quality transcription.

## Solution
A standalone Electron-based dictation application that:
- Can be activated with a specific keyboard shortcut (Home key)
- Displays a minimal, non-intrusive UI with live audio visualization
- Processes speech through Groq's advanced AI models
- Inserts transcribed text directly into the active text field on macOS

## Target Audience
- Individual users seeking an enhanced dictation experience on macOS
- Users who prefer keyboard-driven workflows
- Users who need high-quality transcription for personal or professional use

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Electron for cross-platform desktop application
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for UI components
- **UI Design**: Material Design principles
- **Speech Processing**: Groq API via groq-sdk
- **Packaging**: electron-builder for creating distributable macOS application

## Features
1. **Keyboard-Triggered Recording**
   - Start/stop recording with the Home key
   - Option to hold key for continuous recording or press once to toggle

2. **Visual Feedback**
   - Minimal popup at the bottom center of the screen
   - Live waveform animation during recording
   - Status indicators for recording, processing, and completion

3. **Audio Processing**
   - Integration with Groq API for speech-to-text
   - Support for transcription and translation
   - Microphone selection capability

4. **Text Insertion**
   - Automatic insertion of transcribed text into the focused text field
   - Support for various text applications on macOS

5. **Data Storage**
   - Local storage of transcription history in text files
   - Simple retrieval of past transcriptions

## Scope and Limitations
- **In Scope**:
  - macOS application development
  - Basic dictation functionality
  - Simple text file storage
  - Microphone selection
  - Material Design UI

- **Out of Scope**:
  - Cross-platform support beyond macOS
  - Advanced editing of transcriptions
  - Database integration (planned for future)
  - User accounts and cloud synchronization
  - Advanced security features

## Future Considerations
- Database integration for more robust storage
- Enhanced editing capabilities for transcriptions
- User profiles with customizable settings
- Integration with additional AI services
- Expanded language support
